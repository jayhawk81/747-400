This Smartcopilot config file has been tested on the master version of mSparks43 747-400. \

For an enjoyable experience follow all Smartcopilot requirements about having the same scenery, mesh, addons.
It's probably easier if you follow the readme file posted by Birdy.dma, on the Zibo forum. See below link

My friend Devinci and I put this config together and synced all the buttons and switches we could find a dataref for.

The FMC is also synced, but you need to first make sure that both airplanes are using the same simConfig options.
It's probably easier to share you config files with your flying partner before launching the sim.

Master should reset fuel quantity to 0 from x-plane menu prior to connection. After connecting, master can load fuel and payload using the FMC.

REMEMBER that data must be uploaded to the slave, so don't go click happy to avoid commands being lost.
If things don't appear to be synced, disconnect smartcopilot, make adjustments for both airplanes to have same state, then reconnect.

Only master must use weather, unless both side have the same external weather injector


Installation:
Obviously both sides need to install smartcopilot plugin to be able to use this

Drop the smartcopilot.cfg file into the root of the mSparks43 747 mod


Know Issues:

Not really an issue, but for now, we have not yet synced any failures, or warnings. This will come later.


Safe Flying
